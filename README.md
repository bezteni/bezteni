# Portfolio

## About me
I am a positive thinker  who has two strengths. On the one hand, I am organized and attentive to details due to my academic background and experience as an editor. And on the other hand, due to my character, I communicate effectively with people and love to solve problems.

I graduated from university with two majors: philosopher with a teaching license and journalist. However, throughout my career I have worked closely with a project manager and a team of developers and designers. 

Now I want to apply my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am learning techniques and tools by taking online courses and testing web applications built for educational purposes. Since January 2024, I have been studying test automation at RedRoverSchool (US, online).

I will be glad to apply my knowledge to testing a working product and gain practical experience. This is a crucial step towards my current career goal of becoming a middle software tester in 2 years.
